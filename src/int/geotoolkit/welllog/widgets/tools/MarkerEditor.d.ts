/**
 * <p>
 * Implements a tool which edits log markers (tops), or allows to visually create them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This tool does not edit the actual marker visual. Instead it fires events which contain all the information
 * which is needed to manipulate or create a log marker. The tool can work in two modes: Edit and Insert.
 * </p>
 * <h4>
 * Edit Mode:
 * </h4>
 * <p>
 * Draws handles on top of a log marker which has been associated with the tool. When handles are clicked and
 * dragged, either draws a ghost in the dragged position, or drags the actual handle. In ghost mode, no events
 * are fired until the handles are released (by releasing the mouse button). In ghost mode set to false, fires dragging
 * events every time a move occurs.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a mouse down occurs, "dragstart" event is fired with parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>depth: The depth (y) in track model limits representing the position of the pointer</li>
 * <li>shape: The log visual which is being manipulated
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>When a mouse up occurs, "dragend" event is fired with parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>depth: The depth (y) in track model limits representing the position of handles</li>
 * <li>shape: The log visual which is being manipulated
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>If a mouse move occurs, "dragging" event is fired (When ghost mode is set to false) with parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>depth: the new depth (y) of the handles, resultant from the dragging action</li>
 * <li>shape: The log visual which is being manipulated
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Insert Mode:</h4>
 * <p>
 * Fires an "insert" event when a mouse down on the track occurs.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a mouse down occurs, "insert" event is fired with following arguments:
 * <ul>
 * <li>depth: The depth (y) of the mouse pointer in the model of the track where a log marker should be inserted</li>
 * <li>shape: The log track where to insert the marker
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </br>
 * <h3>Working With Marker Editor</h3>
 * <p>
 *     For Marker Editor to work, it always needs a reference to either the marker which is being manipulated, or to the
 *     track where a marker will be inserted. To start operating the tool enable it through setEnabled() and  pass the
 *     appropriate shape to the tool through setShape(). To disassociate the Marker Editor and hide the handles without
 *     disabling the tool call setShape with a null argument.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated since 4.0. Use {@link @int/geotoolkit/welllog/widgets/tools/editors/MarkerEditor~MarkerEditor} with
 * {@link @int/geotoolkit/welllog/widgets/tools/WellLogVisualsEditingTool~WellLogVisualsEditingTool} instead
