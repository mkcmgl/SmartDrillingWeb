/**
 * Default implementation for the picking renderer mechanism.<br>
 * <br>
 * This class uses rendering as a way to do picking.<br>
 * The idea is similar to the one used here: {@link http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu.html THREEJS tutorial}<br>
 * Instead of rendering color in each pixel, it will render more information coded as a rgba pixel.<br>
 * Then it will read the pixel and extract the information encoded in it.<br>
 * <br>
 * To do so, it will replace the current materials by custom shader-materials which will encode the required information into the pixel.<br>
 * The picking might require several steps to retrieve all the information it needs, for each pass one rgba component will be read from the graphic card.<br>
 * Typically it will execute the picking-rendering 4 passes:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>shape-identifier: First pass to find which shapes is at the given position using its identifier</li>
 * <li>x-coordinate: Another pass to retrieve the world x coordinate at the pick position</li>
 * <li>y-coordinate: Another pass to retrieve the world y coordinate at the pick position</li>
 * <li>z-coordinate: Another pass to retrieve the world z coordinate at the pick position</li>
 * </ul>
 * For each pass, the scene will be reconfigured to write the corresponding attribute in place of the regular pixels.<br>
 * One could add more passes to the picking by declaring them in the #getExtraPickingModes() of the picking material.<br>
 * <br>
 * Unlike the Raycasting approach, the picking occurs on the GPU, which means that:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Vertex&Fragment shader are supported</li>
 * <li>No distance based criteria, the shape rendered at the given pixel coordinates is the one picked</li>
 * <li>Performance is based on frame rendering performance only, however it may require several frames for a single picking operation</li>
 * <li>Returns only the closest object(s) to the camera (the one(s) visible on screen), transparency is ignored. (see filtering)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Note that this picking implementation accepts a width&height parameters to select shapes in a rectangle centered on the given coordinates.<br>
 * A given shape will be returned only once even if it has several pixels in the picked area.<br>
 * The results entry for such case would correspond to the pixel closest to the given picking coordinate.<br>
 * For example if the picked object fills the whole area being picked.<br>
 * Then the picking coordinates returned will match the center of the picked rectangle.<br>
 * <br>
 * This picking also accepts a 'filter' function that can hide objects that are not pickable.<br>
 * As this filtering occurs prior to said GPU picking it may make some objects pickable even if those were initially hidden.<br>
 * For example, if a cube is behind a plane, it's not pickable because it's hidden.<br>
 * But if a filter that discards the plane is given, then the cube can be picked 'through' the plane.<br>
 * This feature is intended to implement picking through non opaque object not as a convenience filter to ignore some shapes.<br>
